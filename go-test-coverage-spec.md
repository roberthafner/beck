# Feature Specification: Go Test Coverage Analyzer & Test Generator

**Project**: Beck  
**Created**: 2025-09-20  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "Build an application that can help analyze unit test code coverage for a golang project and use the code coverage to generate new unit tests to improve the coverage."

## Executive Summary

A comprehensive CLI application that analyzes Go project test coverage, identifies uncovered code paths, and automatically generates intelligent unit tests to improve coverage. The tool combines static code analysis, coverage profiling, and AI-powered test generation to provide actionable insights and automated solutions for Go developers.

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
A Go developer wants to improve their project's test coverage. They run the analyzer on their Go project, receive a detailed coverage report identifying specific uncovered functions and code paths, and then use the tool to automatically generate comprehensive unit tests for the uncovered areas, significantly reducing the manual effort required to achieve high test coverage.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** a Go project with existing code and partial test coverage, **When** user runs the coverage analyzer, **Then** system provides detailed coverage report with specific uncovered functions, branches, and statements
2. **Given** a coverage analysis showing gaps, **When** user requests test generation, **Then** system creates complete, runnable test files with multiple test cases covering edge cases and error conditions
3. **Given** complex functions with multiple code paths, **When** user runs test generation, **Then** system creates table-driven tests covering all branches and conditions
4. **Given** functions with external dependencies, **When** user generates tests, **Then** system creates tests with appropriate mocks and dependency injection patterns
5. **Given** an existing test suite, **When** user runs incremental analysis, **Then** system only generates tests for newly uncovered code without duplicating existing tests
6. **Given** generated tests, **When** user runs them, **Then** all generated tests compile and run successfully, improving overall coverage

### Edge Cases
- What happens when Go project has complex build constraints or multiple modules?
- How does system handle functions with interface parameters requiring mocks?
- What happens when existing tests have compilation errors that prevent coverage analysis?
- How does system handle very large codebases with thousands of functions?
- What happens when generated tests conflict with existing test naming conventions?
